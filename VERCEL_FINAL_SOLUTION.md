# Vercel Build Issue - Complete Resolution

## Current Problem
Vercel attempting to build frontend with `vite build` but dependencies not available in serverless environment.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Vercel auto-detecting project as full-stack app requiring frontend build
2. Package.json has build scripts that reference Vite
3. Serverless functions should work independently without frontend build

## Final Solution Strategy
Since this is a teacher assistant that needs to work in production, we need either:

**Option A: Full Static Build**
- Install dependencies and build frontend properly
- Serve static files through Vercel

**Option B: Serverless Functions Only**  
- Disable all build commands
- Use only API endpoints for functionality

**Implementing Option B (Serverless Only):**

Changes made:
- vercel.json: Disabled build/install commands
- This prevents Vercel from trying to build frontend
- API functions will work independently

## Next Steps
1. Commit current changes
2. If successful: API-only deployment working
3. If needed: Implement full frontend build later

The teacher assistant core functionality lives in the API endpoints, so this approach maintains essential features while resolving deployment issues.
