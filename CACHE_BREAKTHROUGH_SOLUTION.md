# Vercel Cache Breakthrough - Final Solution

## Strategy
Completely bypass Vercel's persistent cache by:
1. Removing problematic api/index.js entirely
2. Creating new api/main.js with ES module syntax
3. Routing all traffic through rewrites to main.js
4. This forces Vercel to use fresh function deployment

## Technical Implementation
- Deleted: api/index.js (cached CommonJS version)
- Created: api/main.js (clean ES module implementation)  
- Updated: vercel.json with rewrite rules
- Result: Complete cache invalidation and fresh deployment

## Expected Outcome
This eliminates the "module is not defined" error by ensuring Vercel cannot access the cached CommonJS version of index.js.
