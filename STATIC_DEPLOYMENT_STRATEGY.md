# Static Deployment Strategy - Final Approach

## Issue Resolution
Vercel rewrites not working properly with serverless functions. Switching to static HTML deployment approach.

## New Strategy
1. Build process copies static HTML to public directory
2. Vercel serves static files directly (no serverless function conflicts)
3. API endpoints remain available at /api/* paths
4. Eliminates all ES module cache issues

## Implementation
- api/main.html: Static version of landing page
- vercel.json: Modified build command to copy HTML file
- Result: Clean static deployment with working API endpoints

This approach completely sidesteps the serverless function caching problems.
